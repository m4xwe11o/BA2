   abstract = {The world of mobile phones is currently inhabited by three large rivals. We have Apple with their iOS devices, Microsoft with the Windows Phone line, and various devices with Googles Android operating system. Developing for all platforms individually is labour intensive and time consuming. Therefore cross-platform development is of interest for companies large as small. The technique which gives performance closest to native development is called cross compiling, which compiles native applications from a common codebase. This thesis takes a closer look at the performance of the tool Xamarin Platform, in which applications for iOS, Windows Phone and Android can be created. The performance of Xamarin Platform applications on iOS and Android is native for most user interface components. Network performance is native or better. However computational tasks are very slow compared to natively developed applications. Xamarin PlatformWindows Phone applications are not covered by this thesis. },

abstract={In this multi-screen world, we spend most of our time shifting through devices from desktops to laptops, tablets, and smart phones, in different modes, sequentially and simultaneously. Orchestration of these learning contents from multiple devices is not an easy task. It is also a fact that there has been an explosive growth of mobile devices and practically every learner nowadays has a mobile device. This represents an immense potential for learning purposes. Mobile learning is undoubtedly not e-learning on mobiles. Expecting all e-learning courses designed for desktops to work equally well on mobiles is against the basic thinking of ubiquitous learning, since each of these devices is perfected for different needs, and possesses unique features. Presently, most of the rapid e-learning development tools in the market do not support responsive design. The aim of this research has been to develop a responsive mobile learning application and to investigate on its ability to provide content adaptation based on certain conditions such as limited bandwidth. A mechanism has been designed whereby the mobile device can identify the strength of the Internet connection available. The system operates on two metrics; round trip time and bandwidth and using these two metrics, contents to be displayed on the mobile device are eventually adapted. Azure Cloud storage has been used to build this platform. The resulting application is cross-platform and can be run on Android, Windows phone and iOS.},

abstract={Mobile Developers of this generation want their apps to be available on all the platforms. For example: - iOS, Android and Windows Phone etc. Since each platform works on a different environment and a completely different language it gets difficult for developers at times. Because of this we can see the beginning of many cross- platform technologies which can help to achieve different platforms. But in reality it is tougher to achieve all the platform-specific Native features and specially to get the performance similar to native applications. With cross- platform technology you can write the business logic once and shared among all the different platforms. Currently there are number of cross-platform frameworks which are available.
In this paper we are focusing on Xamarin Framework. Xamarin is a cross-platform framework which promises many unbelievable features to build mobile applications. Xamarin claims whatever you used to do with Java, Objective-C or Swift, the same thing you can achieve with C#, a single language used by Xamarin. Accessing all the features of C#, and its .Net libraries you can build Android, iOS and Windows Native apps.},
